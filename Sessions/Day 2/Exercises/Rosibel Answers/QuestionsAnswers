/////// QUESTION  1 ////////////
 Once the exercice 2 has been set up, I  have done the following:
git checkout basic-js
git pull
git checkout {your version of the basic-js branch you've been working on}
git merge --no-ff basic-js
I expected that the last command would have broguth everything that was in basic-js into mine branch. 
However the structure of the files in basic-js is different from mine. E.g In basic-js in github I have :
    Exercises
        functions
        object
        scope   
        tests
        types
        utils
        variables
    Instruction
    notes.js
My branch called RosibelVrnachFromBasicJs has the following structure
    Exercises
        Rosibel Asnwers
            Instructions
            notes
            object
            RosibleExercice
            scopetypes
            variables
        functions
        tests
        utils

when I do  git status(being in my branch) I get up to date
/////// QUESTION  2 ////////////
Are these two things the same:

const subtractFive = (a) => {
  let value = a;
  return (value - 5);
};

and

const subtractFive = (a) => {
  return (a - 5);
};
